</p>

<p align="left">
 Samurai sudoku puzzles consist of five overlapping sudoku grids. The standard sudoku rules apply to each 9 x 9 grid. Place digits from 1 to 9 in each empty cell. Every row, every column, and every 3 x 3 box should contain one of each digit.

and this is a simple app written in c++ using SDL2 to implement a samurai sudoku, no solver, but you can solve it by yourself ;)
